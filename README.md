# pianokeys

This is a quick program I threw together to help with learning to play the piano, based on
[Bill Hilton's Keyboard familiarisation game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBH6IpRkVDs) from his first video.

Instructions for how to play the game are explained in the video.

I ran this program on my laptop next to my piano keyboard, and used the space key and enter to quickly get a new note to play.
Personally, I thought this was easier than thinking of random keys.

I don't actually expect anyone else to use this, but I figured it's a backup of the code if nothing else.
